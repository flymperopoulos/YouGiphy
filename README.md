This repository will hold our project for OlinJS Lab2 - Mashup

---------------

We used Twitter Login Authentication along with the Giphy API to make a fun and simple application, where users can enjoy their favorite gifs, by typing a tweet with hashtag of the word that describes it.

### Usage:

If you want to run the application locally: 

- Make sure to update: `$ npm install`
- Update your credentials in `oauth.js`
- Run: `$ nodemon app.js` (nodemon is the best)
- Have fun!
